# Driver State Detection

The Driver State Detection project is designed to monitor and analyze the behavior of drivers using 68 Facial Keypoint positions. 

The primary objective of this project is to identify the driver's state while operating a vehicle, particularly during level 2 autonomous driving modes. The model demonstrates robust performance in both daytime and nighttime conditions. 

Utilizing facial keypoints, the system maps various facial features to calculate parameters such as eye lid positions and regions of interest (ROI) around the eyes. Based on these calculations, the model predicts the driver's state, focusing on five distinct states:

1. Normal State
2. Sleep State
3. Looking Away State
4. Distracted State
5. Tired State

This project offers a comprehensive approach to enhancing driver safety by detecting and addressing potential hazards arising from various driver states.
